Creation of AWS EC2 on Specific VPC

First Run the Script, if you have no existing KeyPair. After creating one KeyPair, the script asks you to create another one then answer 'NO' cuz you have already 
created one.

Rerun the script again and there you can create EC2 on Specific VPC ....

Thank you !!!!!!!
